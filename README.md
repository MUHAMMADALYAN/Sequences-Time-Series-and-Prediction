# Sequence Models

# RNN
RNN is very helpful as in time series e.g in Stock Market Pervious day data has impact on next day so for this we use RR NN which takes output of pervious cell and input it to next day cell.  and hene preiction of future values become accurate.

# LSTM
LSTM is very helpful as in time series e.g in Stock Market Pervious day data or pervious week has impact on next day so for this we use LSTM which takes output of pervious cell as well used a cell state that keeps state of all previous cell throught life of training this means data from earlier window can have great impact on overall projection , the state can be birectional in text it has great impact but not significant in Numbers therefore we use bi directional and hene preiction of future values become accurate.
